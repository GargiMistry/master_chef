Itâ€™s surprisingly easy to make homemade cheese bread. This soft buttery yeasted bread is twisted up with cheddar cheese, but you can use any cheese variety you love. Bake the bread in a loaf pan, then slice it to reveal the 2 cups of swirled cheese inside. For a sweet version, try our cinnamon crunch bread.

The inspiration behind this recipe comes from a local bakery, where Iâ€™ve picked up DOZENS of cheese bread loaves. Each of us love it, my almost 2 year old being the biggest fan. â™¥

Cheese and bread. Itâ€™s obviously the greatest loaf of all time.

So I decided to make it myself. Brace yourself for impact!

What is Cheese Bread?
Letâ€™s back up. This cheese bread is homemade bread swirled with real cheese. Itâ€™s a simple yeasted dough that I adapted from my sweeter homemade cinnamon swirl bread and my basic sandwich bread. Each slice is extra soft with a chewy crust and ribbons of melted cheese throughout. For extra flavor, brush the top of the unbaked bread with garlic herb butter. The cheese on top crisps up, while the garlic butter infuses down into the bread.

I have 3 loaves in the freezer right now. Things would become dangerous if there wasnâ€™t a constant stash of cheese bread in our house.

Ingredients in Cheese Bread
Buttermilk: Liquid activates the yeast. For soft, flavorful, and chewy cheese bread, use a combination of buttermilk and water. Nondairy, whole, or low fat milks work too, but buttermilk produces phenomenal flavor and texture.
Water: Although you could use all milk as the liquid in this dough, I preferred a mix of water and buttermilk. All milk made this taste more like an overly soft dessert bread.
Yeast: You can use active dry yeast or instant yeast. If using active dry yeast, the rise times will be a little longer. I recommend Platinum Yeast from Red Star, which is an instant yeast that is blended with natural dough improvers.
Sugar: Sugar feeds the yeast, increases its activity, and tenderizes the dough.
Melted Butter: Butter promises a soft and flavorful bread. Use melted butter. I found that room temperature butter produced a cakey-er and less flavorful end product.
Egg: 1 egg provides structure and flavor.
Salt: Bread would be seriously lacking flavor without salt!
Garlic Powder: Garlic powder adds incredible flavor to the dough AND to the topping. If using fresh garlic, use 1 finely minced clove in the dough and 1 teaspoon minced garlic in the topping.
Bread Flour: Higher protein flour like bread flour is best for this bread recipe because of its strong gluten formation and high rise. All-purpose flour will yield a flimsy bread.
Cheddar Cheese: I recommend cheddar cheese, but you can use another harder cheese such as pepper jack, gouda, or colby cheese. Avoid very soft cheeses. For best taste and texture, shred the cheese off the block yourself with a cheese grater.

Punch down the risen dough. Roll out into a 9Ã—15 inch rectangle.
Sprinkle cheese all over the top.
Tightly roll the dough into a 15-inch log. Place the log on its seam.
Using a sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise.
Criss-cross one half, cut side down, on top of the other halfâ€“ forming an X. Tightly twist the two together.
Pinch the outer edges to seal as best you can.
By the way, thereâ€™s 2 cups of cheese stuffed inside this bread. ðŸ™‚

After itâ€™s shaped, loosely cover the bread and let it rest for about 30 minutes. During this time, preheat the oven. Right before baking, brush the shaped dough with melted butter, garlic powder, and chopped parsley. Chopped basil would be excellent, too!
